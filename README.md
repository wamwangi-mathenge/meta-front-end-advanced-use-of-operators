# Exercise: Advanced Use of Operators

## Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skills based on the value saved in their score.

1. Create a variable named score and set it to 8
2. Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to 0 and below 10 using the && operator


## Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, you're about to code some snippets related to the game over condition
You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

1. Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

2. Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

3. Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".
